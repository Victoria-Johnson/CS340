# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In this project I used clear, descriptive names for functions, variables, and classes. Dividing my code into distinct modules or components, each responsible for a specific aspect of the functionality. In relation to the project I used classes or functions to encapsulate CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete). This helped isolate database logic from application logic. Using inline comments helped explain complex logic or important sections of the code. In the future I would write different unit tests for my CRUD functions to ensure they work correctly in isolation.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Approaching a problem as a computer scientist involves a structured process of understanding the problem, designing a solution, implementing it, and iterating based on feedback. The Grazioso Salvare project required integrating multiple components (database, CRUD module, dashboard), which was more complex than previous assignments that might have focused on individual tasks or simpler projects. Next time I would pptimize queries and database design to ensure efficient performance.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists design systems that automate repetitive tasks, increasing efficiency and productivity. This automation helps businesses operate more smoothly and focus on strategic goals. From this project, integrating a comprehensive dashboard with data visualization capabilities, the company can gain real-time insights into their operations, customer behavior, and other key metrics. This supports better decision-making and strategic planning.
